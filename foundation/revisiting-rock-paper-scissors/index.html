        <li><h1>What are branches in git?</h1></li>    
        <h3><ul>
            <li>In Git, branches are pointers to snapshots of your changes. </li>
            <li>They allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously. Each branch can be considered an independent line of development.</li>
            <li>The master or main branch is typically the default, representing the official project history.</li>
            <li>Creating a new branch allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main codebase</li>
            <li>When a branch is ready, you can merge it back into the main branch. This workflow helps manage multiple development efforts efficiently.</li>
        </ul></h3>

        <li><h1>How to create a new branch?</h1></li>
        <h3><ul>
            <li><code>git branch &lt new-branch-name &gt </code></li>
            <li>to create a new branch and switch to it
                <code>git checkout -b &lt new-branch-name &gt</code>
            </li>
        </ul></h3>

        <h1><li>How to view all of your current branches?</li></h1>
        <h3><ul>
            <li>git branch (the one with *asterisk is the current branch)</li>
            <li>git branch -a (will show details)</li>
        </ul></h3>

        <h1><li>How to switch to another branch?</li></h1>
        <h3><code>git checkout &lt branch-name &gt</code></h3>

        <h1><li>How to delete a branch?</li></h1>
        <h3>if the branch has already been merged into main<code>git branch -d &lt branch-name &gt</code></h3>
        <h3>if the branch hasn't been merged into main<code>git branch -D &lt branch-name &gt</code></h3>

        <h1><li>What are use cases for branches?</li></h1>
        <h3><ol>
            <li>Feature Development: Developers can create branches to work on new features independently without affecting the main codebase. This isolation helps manage incomplete or experimental features.</li>
            <li>Bug fixes: Branches allow for the quick creation of isolated environments to fix bugs. Once fixed, the changes can be merged back into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Release Management: Different branches can be used to manage various release versions, such as release-v1.0 or release-v2.0, helping in maintaining and patching old versions while developing new ones.</li>
            <li>Experimentation: Developers can experiment with new ideas or refactor code in branches without risk to the main project. If the experiment is successful, it can be merged; otherwise, the branch can be discarded.</li>
            <li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Branches are integral to CI/CD workflows, allowing for automated testing and deployment of branches before merging into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Collaboration: Branches facilitate collaboration among multiple developers, enabling parallel development and easy integration of changes from different team members.</li>
        </ol></h3>
